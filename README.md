# Scoreboard

This issue is my first ReactJS project which is a Scoreboard created with the help of the ReactJS Treehouse tutorial.

Built using npm and webpack to create the local development environment. Packages included:
- React
- ReactDOM
- PropTypes
- createReactClass

Styling done using SASS, a CSS extension language. To use this, download PREPROS to compile the SASS into readable CSS.
